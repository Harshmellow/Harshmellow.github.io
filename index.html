		<h1 class="header-text">I grew up during the 2000's</h1>
		<p class="header-text">For me the internet was much more than a chat room gimick that it was for many 90's kids. It was the start of the truely popular internet. With the early 2000's being known as the (.com) age for brand name company being in there infancy including ["Google","Yahoo"","Opentable","Amazon",""]</p>
		
		
		<p class="header-text">While the 90's was the very begining of the popular internet, there was clear limitations to what could be accomplished back then.</p>

		which consists of many of my family members andc close friends("like a time-capsule"). Web design is not the of what I learned this summer, far from it.</p>

			<p class="youtube">I have praised youtube for being open minded , and having the ability to have anyone share themselves without cencorship unlike hollywood. But as time goes on
			youtube leans closer and closer to a hollywood type format, which I am afraid might eventually hurt youtube in the long wrong, since there not hollywood. There the platform that holds youtubers such 
			as FilthyFrank and Idubbtz or content like Smosh.</p>
